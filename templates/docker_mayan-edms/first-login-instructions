Before logging in the first time, execute the mayan container and
change the admin password.

$ docker exec -it mayan_app_1 (or whatever the container's name is)

Then, in the container, navigate to /opt/mayan-edms/bin and run

$ ./mayan-edms.py createsuperuser

If the admin user already exists, run the following to change the password

$ ./mayan-edms.py changepassword admin
