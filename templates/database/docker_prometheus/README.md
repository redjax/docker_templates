# Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) is a time series database & monitoring system with a "pull" architecture. Using a [`node_exporter`](./node_exporter/) container, Prometheus can connect to 1 or more remote machines to "pull" metrics like CPU/RAM usage, hard drive space, etc.
