# NocoDB

`nocodb` is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to [Airtable](https://airtable.com).

The easiest way to get up and running with `nocodb` is to choose a Docker Compose stack from [the NocoDB repository](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/tree/develop/docker-compose).

## Usage

This stack is ready to be run as-is. It is recommended you change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` password variable in your [`.env`](./.env.example) file before running.

To bring the stack up, simply run `docker compose up -d`.
