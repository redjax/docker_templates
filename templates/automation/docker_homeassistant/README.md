# HomeAssistant

[HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) is an open source home automation tool. The server is [self-hostable](https://github.com/home-assistant/core), and can [integrate with a huge number of services](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/?brands=featured). You can self-host instances of [node-red](https://nodered.org) and [n8n](https://n8n.io), too, and add even more integrations via those tools.
