# Custom Settings

After starting the server with Docker Compose, copy the settings from one of the files in this path to `../vrising/persist/Settings/`. There are 2 settings files, `ServerGameSettings.json` (options for gameplay like castle decay & teleporting with bound items) and `ServerHostSettings.json` (server configuration like game/world name and game mode).

Restart the container to apply the settings.
